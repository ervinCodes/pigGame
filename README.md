# Pig Dice Game
A dice game made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  This project was created to hone my skills using Javascript and DOM manipulation.

Pig Game is a simple dice game which in its basic form is playable with just a single dice. You win by being the first player to score 100 or more points.


## How to Play

To run the game, make sure to click on CODE > download ZIP and open on your code editor.

## Rules
Choose a player to go first. That player throws a dice and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.

If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the dice to the next player.

Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.
